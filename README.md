# Learning Hub V12 — Content Quality

V12 focuses on cognitive quality, variety and logical reliability rather than adding more product surface.

## Main changes
- Automatic validation of generated content before it is served.
- Anti-repetition for Attention, Memory, Executive Functions, Speed/Reasoning, Applied Cognition and Social Lab.
- Fixed visual-comparison tasks so only one row can match the model.
- Larger Speed & Reasoning bank with several mechanics at every level.
- Applied Cognition expanded with realistic, age-adapted scenarios involving priorities, time, dependencies, uncertainty, monitoring and replanning.
- Social Lab rebuilt around perspective-taking, fact vs inference, pragmatic language, ambiguity, intention vs impact, repair and multi-person social reasoning.
- Scenario cards added to the UI so longer applied/social exercises are easier to read.
- Spain + Latin America locale support from V11 is retained.
- Game Lab remains removed from the user-facing product.

## Testing branch
Upload to `supabase-integration`. Do not merge to `main` until V12 has been tested.

## Backend already deployed
Supabase `request-learning-content` Edge Function has been updated to V13 with the V12 content-quality architecture.
